    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tasty recipe from Japan that offers all the age-defying benefits of a face-lift in a bowl.</p>
    <p>Grouper is full of collagen and, for that reason, it is expensive in Japan and the food of the rich and famous. It is economical in the west, though.</p>
    <p><strong>Serves two:</strong> 420kcal in total, 210kcal per bowl.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 grouper head, plus 100-120g grouper fillet</li> 
        <li>Half a 496g packet of firm tofu <strong>(optional)</strong></li> 
        <li>Half a leek</li> 
        <li>20g Chinese leaf, cut into 2cm strips</li> 
        <li>20g beansprouts</li>
        <li>2 fresh shiitake mushrooms cut into 1cm slices</li> 
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li> 
        <li>1cm root ginger, grated</li>
        <li>5cm mooli, grated</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the fish head and 500ml of water in a large pan. Bring slowly to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for <strong>15 minutes.</strong> Remove and discard the fish head. At this point, you may chill, or freeze, the soup base in cubes. <strong>It will be extremely low in calories in this ungarnished state.</strong></li>
        <li>Cut the tofu <em>(if using)</em> into two centimetre cubes. Cut the leek into three centimetre chunks, then cut these into lengthways strips.</li>
        <li>Return the fish stock to the boil, then add the grouper fillet, tofu, leek, Chinese leaf, beansprouts and shiitake mushrooms. Cover and cook over a medium heat for <strong>10 minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Uncover and add the soy sauce, ginger and mooli. Serve immediately in warmed bowls.</li>
