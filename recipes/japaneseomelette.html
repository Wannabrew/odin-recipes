        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Japanese omelette is denser than the Western type and is typically cut into slices. These can then be either eaten traight away, chilled for up to three days, or wrapped and frozen.</p>
        <p>When sugar is added, it is usually used to top or fill sushi; whereas the sugar-free version is used in hot food. <em>Obviously children prefer the version with sugar!</em></p>
